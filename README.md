The project was developed as a master thesis in the field of Digital Humanities using several key technologies. The QiSDK 2.9 serves as the main software development kit for controlling the Pepper robot through Android and Kotlin.
Kotlin was chosen as the primary programming language due to its modern syntax and seamless integration with the Android framework.
Development was carried out in Android Studio Bumblebee, which provided the necessary environment for managing the project structure, dependencies, and deployment to Pepper.
The system builds upon softbankrobotics-labs/pepper-point-at, an open-source gesture library that enables Pepper to point accurately at objects in its environment.
allowing wireless control and gesture execution. The application was tested and demonstrated on Pepper 1.8a,
a humanoid robot model equipped with advanced sensors and expressive motion capabilities.
This APP was launched at the "Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften 2025" at the Friedrich Alexander University
