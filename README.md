# Show-me-around
Android application for the humanoid robot Pepper 1.8a, based on softbankrobotics-labs/pepper-point-at. Developed as part of my master’s thesis for the “Long Night of Science” event, enabling Pepper to guide visitors to event rooms through gesture-based pointing.

The project was developed using the QiSDK 2.9, which serves as the main software development kit for controlling the Pepper robot through Android Studio Version Bumblebee and programming language Kotlin. Kotlin was chosen as the primary programming language due to its modern syntax and seamless integration with the Android framework. Development was carried out in Android Studio, which provided the necessary environment for managing the project structure, dependencies, and deployment to Pepper. The system builds upon softbankrobotics-labs/pepper-point-at, an open-source gesture library that enables Pepper to point accurately at objects in its environment. The application was tested and demonstrated on Pepper 1.8a, a humanoid robot model equipped with advanced sensors and expressive motion capabilities. It was successfully launched at the "Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften 2025" at the Friedrich Alexander University.
